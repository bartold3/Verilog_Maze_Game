The SidewinderMaze.java and writeToMif.java files along with the mazex119x119.txt files are used to generate the random mazes and then convert those mazes into the mif files to be read by the verilog code. Sidewindermaze file generates the random maze, then paste the output from the console into the mazex119x119.txt file and then the writeToMif file reads from the mazex119x119.txt file and then translates the maze data over to the mif file to be incorperated in the verilog maze engine.
